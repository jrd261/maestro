%BUILDMASTERFIELDS Generates a master field
%   BUILDMASTERFIELDS(REDUCTION) will build a master field from the FITS
%   objects stored in the "OBJECT" list.

%% PREPARE TO BUILD A MASTER FIELD
% We will need some things to be initialized before we really get underway.
% The configuration needs to be loaded as we will use it quite frequently
% in this method. An array to hold some tenative master fields and a
% structure for storing geometric solutions need to be initialized. A
% maestro process will be initialized as well.

% Extract the current maestro configuration. Several pieces of information
% will be extracted. It would probably be advantageous to list them here
% and this will be done in the future. This is sort of a collection of
% global variables. When called with no arguments the "MCONFIG" function
% returns the current maestro confugration. See "MCONFIG" for more
% information.
MaestroConfiguration = mconfig;

% Extract the current object FITS list. This retrieves the list of fits
% objects currently loaded into maestro. If there are no FITS objects
% currently loaded this function will throw an error so we are guarenteed
% to retrieve at least one fits object. For more information on what a fits
% object actually is see the maestro "FITS" object.
FITSList = mfits('retrieve','OBJECT');

% Initialize a structure to store master fields. This will store the geometry
% of the stars, galaxies and objects found on images.
% For more information about what this variable looks like when populated
% look near the end of the code. Also initialize a structure to contain
% information about the solution to each of the images to be processed.
% This will store the geometric transform required to take stars from this
% image and project them onto the master field. Both variables are
% written directly to the HSPReduction property by the same name when this
% routine completes.
MasterField = [];
rotationAngles = nan(length(FITSList),1);
rotationStyles = zeros(length(FITSList),1);

% This function can take some time to execute as all images will be loaded
% once if they are not already loaded. Use a process to keep the user
% notified as to the state of this function. Record the process ID "pid".
% See the "MPROCESSINIT" function for more information.
pid = mprocessinit(['\n Searching for stars on ',num2str(length(FITSList)),' images...']);

        %% BUILD PERMUTATION MATRICIES
        % Here we will generate sets of indicies we will refer to as
        % permutations. A permutation of target stars/sources might
        % look like [1,2,3,4] meaning stars/sources [1,2,3,4] are part
        % of this permutation. This code will simply generate all
        % possible combinations (n choose k, meaning [1,2,3,4] will be
        % generated but not [3,2,1,4]) of both target and master
        % stars/sources. Above we determined how many sources we could
        % include per permutation (NNS, in all of these examples I
        % included 4 but a permutation could look like [1,2,3,4,5]) and
        % how many stars we would take from the target and master
        % fields (NNT and NNS). This is limited in cases where too many
        % stars are present for computational purposes. The data will
        % have n rows, where n is the number of possible permuataions.
        % We store the data in the variables PPT and PPM for "Target
        % Permutations" and "Master Permutations" respectively. Note
        % that at this point the matricies PPT and PPM have no
        % relationship to eachother as they will in the future. The
        % only thing they have in common is the same number of
        % stars/sources per row. See the matlab built in function
        % NCHOOSEK for more information. Note the arrays are transposed
        % from the output of NCHOOSEK.
        PTP = nchoosek(1:NUT,NPS);
        PMP = nchoosek(1:NUM,NPS);
        
        %% ENSURE STAR ORDER INVARIANCE
        % The order of appearance of the stars in each permutation is
        % mildly random and as the permutations are nchoosek we do not
        % repeat the same permutation in a different order. What I mean
        % by this is that we will not have a permutation [1,2,3,4] and
        % [2,3,4,1], this combination will only appear once. It would
        % square the number of computations needed (at least) to use
        % all possible orders. Because we only used each permutation of
        % stars/sources once, we want to make sure that the order of
        % stars/sources is invarient, so that if [1,2,3] is the same on
        % the target image as stars/sources [3,2,4], but the order
        % generated is [2,3,4]. We need to ensure that the stars will
        % line up regardless. To accomplish this we will sort the order
        % of the stars/sources as to make the order, ie 1,2,3, spiral
        % the stars/sources out from the stars/sources average
        % position. In the case where there are only two stars this
        % method doesn't really work well. For two star cases we will
        % perform another algorithm.
        
        % The first thing to do is to extract the x and y positions for
        % each permutation. This will create nxm matricies where n is
        % the index of the permutation and m is the index of the stars
        % within the permutation. The name of the variables is XXM for
        % the x position of the master field etc. Remember that the 2nd
        % and 3rd rows of the GGM and TTM (which contain all of of the
        % information about the stars/sources on the target and master
        % images) store the x and y positions of the stars
        % respectively.
        XXM = reshape(CMG(2,PMP)',size(PMP));

        % For each permutation calculate the mean x and y values and
        % subtract these values from the the x and y values
        % respectively. We have to use REPMAT to make the size of the
        % mean of each permutation equal to the size of each
        % permutation. Sort the resultant permutations (along the
        % direction of the stars). This will return the sorted matrix
        % (which we dont care about) and indicies reflected the order

        % simple reference. The indicies are transposed, essentilly added to a

        %% ROTATE THE TARGET COORDINATES
        % Unforunately the target images may be rotated with respect to
        % the master field. There are four possibilities for rotation.
        % The first is no rotation, then flipping, CCW 1/day, and CW
        % 1/day. We will take the current possible solutions and copy
        % each of them so that the solution exists 4 times. For each
        % one of those solutions we will rotate the target field in
        % each of these patterns. This will allow us to completely
        % forget about rotation as a degrree of freedom and sacrifice
        % 4 times computational efficiency. IMO the robustness of this
        % process is worth the extra computation.
        
        % First increase the number of possible solutions by a factor
        % of four. What this essentially does is make four copies of
        % all of the current solutions. Each of these four copies will
        % be assigned a different style of rotation. We have to make
