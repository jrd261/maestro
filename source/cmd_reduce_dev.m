function  cmd_reduce_dev(args)
%CMD_REDUCE_DEV is the MAESTRO command to reduce a FITS image set (DEVELOPMENT VERSION).
%   CMD_REDUCE_DEV(ARGS) will reduce a set of FITS images and save the
%   reduction to disk.

% Record the staring time of the reduction. This is a some matlab
% definition of absolute time in terms of days.

%% ASSIGN STAR FIELD LABELING FILE
% If a star field was specified it is recorded with the 'assignfield'
% action of the mhspred control function.

%% BUILD LISTS OF FITS FILES
% The files that will be used for the reduction can be specified from the
% users end in four different ways.
% 1) The bias, dark, flat, and object files can be specified manually, each
% with their own flag.
% 2) Lists of object, bias, flat, and dark files.
% 3) If no arguments and no flags relavant to files were specified we will
% autobuild using /<pwd>/* as the file specification.

%% CHECK OUTPUT FILE NAME
% The last thing we would want to do is to perform the whole reduction only
% to find out the output path is write protected. There are several ways
% (from the users pov) that the output file name can be specified. 
% 1) The second argument or a flag to the command could specify the output path.
% 2) The second argument of a flag to the command could specify the output
% filename.
% 3) No output name was specified and we will generate one automatically.

% Obtain the path, name, and ext of the specified file. If none was
% specified, path will contain the pwd and name and ext will be empty.Also
% check that the output path exists and is writable. If it does not exist
% this command will create it. If it is not writable this command will
% throw an error.
if isempty(args.OUTPUT_NAME)
    path = pwd;
    name = '';
    ext = '';
else            
    [path,name,ext] = fileparts(mrelpath(args.OUTPUT_NAME{1},pwd)); 
    if isdir([path,filesep,name,ext])
        path = [path,filesep,name];
        name = '';            
    end            
    mmkdir(path);
end


% "EXT" should contain the part of the filename that follows the first ".".
% The extension of a maestro high speed photometry reduction file is
% ".hsp". If this is not the given extension concatenate this onto the
% given extension.
if ~strcmpi(ext,'.hsp'), ext = [ext,'.hsp']; end


%% BUILD THE CALIBRATION
% The calibration will be built based on the current locale. The
% calibration build will also set the gain and readnoise if biases and
% flats are given. If no bias, darks, and flats were given the calibration
% will still be "built" but will contain no real information.
% Build the calibration by calling the MCAL function. See MCAL for more
% information. Essentially this builds a calibration and stores it for us.
mcal('build');

%% REDUCE THE DATASET 
% The reduction is executed here. We use the MHSPRED function to start the
% reduction. If the reduction completes we will also save the reduction to
% a file, and dump a bunch of text files pertinant to the reduction if
% asked to. Reduce the data. This is where most of the action occurs. See the
% function MHSPRED for more information. If no errors are thrown we should
% have a fully reduced set of data after this concludes.
mhspred('reducedev');

%% RECORD REDUCTION OUTPUT

% If there was no output name specified ask for the reduction to generate a
% unique name for us. 
if isempty(name), name = mhspred('generatefilename'); end

% Assign the full file name into the reduction.
mhspred('assignfilename',[path,filesep,name,ext]);   

% Attempt to write out the reduction to file. We call the save command
% which will write the object to disk. The filename we retrieved above will
% be used. We append a / between the path and filename and add the
% extension .hpr to the end of the filename.
%mhspred('save'); % Disabled until hsp files are used

% Here we check if we should dump the data if the user wants a bunch of
% text files containing information about the reduction. This will create a
% directory matching the filename that was generated above. In this
% directory everything about the reduction will be written in a clutter of
% ASCII files.
%if args.DUMP_ALL, mhspred('dump'); end
mhspred('dump');
